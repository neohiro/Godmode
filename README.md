Windows Godmode Activator

The only thing this program does:

Windows God Mode is a special folder that provides easy access to over 250 control panel settings in Windows 10 and 11. You can create it by making a new folder on your desktop and naming it "GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}" to simplify managing your system settings.
